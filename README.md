# Knowledge_Framework
The repository is for my staged knowledge framework. Through markdown, I record important knowledge points and some of my own understanding of knowledge, so that I can review and deepen my understanding of the idea in the future. I will be happy if the knowledge can help you solve some problems. The contents mainly composed of the following parts: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, C++, Python (including tensorflow and pytorch).

# ML_DL.md
Mainly:  Machine Learning, Deep Learning knowledges.
Others: Python, C++, OS, Computer Network, MySQL. 

# EffectiveC++.md
Scott Meyers's famous C++ book: **"Effective C++: 55 Specific Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs"**. Each clause in the notes is not based on the original book's clauses, but the key and essence parts that I consider to be the key, organized in my own way of thinking. Actually, I've read his another two books: "More Effective C++" and "Effective STL", but I haven't organized it into notes. In the future I'll add these two parts.
